## TOC
Sound quality is mediocre, I did not catch everything.  

03:00 interesting intro blockchain  
05:00 mess --> centralized --> decentralized  
07:55 why no big use case yet?  
09:50 why so many different blockchains?  
12:40 Polkadot design idea  
13:15 network effect  
15:00 how to participate (as a chain) in Polkadot?  
15:30  pooled security  
17:20  "the only thing it can do is be extended"  
18:22  you only need to provide one function [validation function]  
18:02  canonicalization, notary  
19:50 relay chain token, stake  
20:35 interview end, presentation start  
21:00 extensible, scalable, ____ options  
21:42 extensible, e.g. zksnarks, encrypted communication; scalable; heterogeneity  
23:55 2 services: pooled security, trust free transactions  
25:00 relay chain & parachains  
25:20 relay chain: no functionality & fees levied for services  
26:15 governance  
26:50 architecture diagram draft  
28:50 issue finalization scheme; BFT PoS Proof of Stake  
29:50 four roles within network: validators/nominators, collators, fishermen  
32:30 four roles - why do they bother?  
33:35 consensus relay-chain  
36:44 validating parachains, PoV Proof of Validity  
38:45 queues  
40:47 availability & punishment (mild)  
43:38 fairness; nearest to "golden ticket" to choose collator sets  
45:11 some issue skipped  
45:27 strongly tied vs weakly tied parachains  
47:00 encrypted private chains possible  
47:48 example: KYC/AML service chain  
48:50 bridged external blockchain  
50:00 questions  
50:27 (?) misbehaviour  
51:00 use cases: example melonport  
52:26 important answer around 53:00  
54:00 analogy  
55:00 example hedgefund  
56:36 ethereum example: (gas) pricing how to? --> mirror contracts on both chains! good example end at 60:52  
61:10 (?) security, validators, collators  
65:42 (?)  
67:47 video end
