## TOC

01:00 intro  
02:55 homomorphic evaluation function  
04:45 this is what it is supposed to provide  
05:00 input privacy  
06:28 compactness  
07:00 Fully H.E.  
08:00 universal set of gates, NAND  
09:25 leveled fully homomorphic encryption, only bounded depth f  
10:10 1978 to 2008 - from idea to 1st solution  
11:10 approximate eigenvector method  
13:22 insecure if exact eigenvector  
13:55 tweak idea: approx eigenvector  
15:35 test addition, works. but noise grows.  
17:38 test multiplication, works only for C_2 small  
20:13 LWE learning with errors, 2005 Regev  
25:25 re-arrange notation  
26:01 encryption scheme from from LWE  
31:40 generalize from vectors to matrices  
33:45 what do we need, small C_2  
35:00 binary decomposition  
39:00 whole scheme, invariant  
42:00 decryption  
44:00 homomorphic operations, e.g. multiplication  
47:24 NAND, noise  
50:10 homomorphic circuit evaluation  
51:20 conclusion
